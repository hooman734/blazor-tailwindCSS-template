### This is a [Blazor-Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/hosting-models?view=aspnetcore-7.0) template using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
----

This project is based on Blazor-Server-Empty version provided in [.NET 7](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0)

Still [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) are required to build the application. However, all the sub-build processes are integrated into MS-Build, so there is no extra dependency beside the ones already mentioned.
